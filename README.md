# Evaluating Change Data Capture Tools: A Comprehensive Guide

Change Data Capture (CDC) is a powerful technology in data engineering that allows for continuously capturing changes (inserts, updates, and deletes) made to source systems. CDC tools fuel analytical apps and mission-critical data feeds in banking and regulated industries, with use cases ranging from data synchronization, managing risk, and preventing fraud to driving personalization.

# Why CDC is More Relevant in Unified Data Architecture

As we advance into the Gen AI era, Change Data Capture (CDC) systems are emerging as crucial components of the ever-evolving data architecture. The ability to capture and propagate data changes in real time opens up numerous opportunities and addresses several contemporary business and technical challenges. Here are some key reasons why CDC is becoming more relevant than ever. 

## The Dominance of the Lakehouses and the Mutation Support

Lakehouses have become a standard pattern in data infrastructure, combining the best features of data lakes and warehouses. Unlike data lakes, which are predominantly append-only, lakehouses support data mutation natively. The support for the mutation feature means they can handle updates and deletions seamlessly, an ability that enhances real-time synchronization through CDC (Change Data Capture) tools. As a result, lakehouses support more dynamic and flexible data architectures, catering to a broader range of analytics and operational workloads. For instance, in a fast-paced retail environment, lakehouses can ensure that inventory data remains up-to-date and accurate in the data warehouse, optimizing supply chain efficiency.

## Modernizing Legacy Systems

Many businesses still rely on legacy systems like Mainframes and SAP for their core operations. However, these businesses must unlock the value within these systems and leverage it in modern, cloud-based analytical environments. CDC tools facilitate nonintrusive data extraction and real-time integration from these legacy systems into modern platforms without disrupting ongoing transactions. This capability is crucial as it allows businesses to modernize their data infrastructure incrementally, ensuring a smooth transition and continuous value extraction from legacy investments.

## Real-Time Business Demands

In today’s fast-paced business environment, responding to real-time events is a competitive advantage. Whether it’s launching targeted marketing campaigns, optimizing supply chains, or personalizing customer experiences, businesses are increasingly demanding real-time insights and actions. CDC enables real-time data flows from operational systems to analytics platforms, ensuring decision-makers can access the most current data. This immediacy is critical for applications that require up-to-the-minute accuracy and responsiveness.

## Emergence of Warehouse-Native Product Analytics

Another significant trend is the shift towards warehouse-native product analytics. Instead of relying on separate analytical databases, many organizations embed analytics directly within their data warehouses. This approach simplifies data architecture and enhances performance by reducing data movement and latency. CDC is integral to this model, ensuring that any changes in transactional data are instantly available for analysis within the data warehouse. This seamless integration supports more sophisticated and timely product analytics, driving better business outcomes.

## Microservices and the Outbox Pattern

The adoption of microservices architecture has transformed how applications are developed and deployed. However, managing data consistency across microservices can be challenging. A common solution is the outbox pattern, where changes are written to an outbox table and then asynchronously processed. CDC systems can efficiently capture and propagate these outbox changes to other services or analytics platforms. This approach ensures data consistency and supports the decoupling of microservices, enabling more scalable and resilient architectures.

## AI/LLM Advancement and Context-Rich Applications

Advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) are driving the need for context-rich applications like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Knowledge Graphs. These applications require comprehensive and up-to-date contextual information to function effectively. CDC provides real-time data feeds to populate and update these knowledge bases continuously. By capturing and integrating data changes from diverse sources, CDC helps build and maintain the context-rich environments that modern AI applications demand.

# Types of CDC Techniques and Their Challenges

## Timestamp-Based CDC

Timestamp-based CDC relies on a timestamp column that tracks the last modification time of a record. It identifies changed records by comparing timestamps, making it less invasive and easy to implement for batch feeds.

### Challenges:

* Modify the database schema to include timestamp columns. Most packaged software backends lack this, requiring alternative extraction methods.  
* Missed changes occur if the timestamp is not updated correctly.  
* Unsuitable for databases without native modification timestamp support.  
* Impacts source system performance during query execution.  
* Does not handle hard deletes.  
* The Schema evolution management pushes to the pipeline code to manage. 

## Table-Diff CDC

Table-diff CDC compares the current state of the data with a previous snapshot to identify changes. This method is often a last resort when other CDC techniques are infeasible.

### Challenges:

* Highly resource-intensive and slow for large datasets.  
* Requires significant storage for maintaining snapshots.  
* Complex to implement and manage.

## Trigger-Based CDC

Trigger-based CDC uses database triggers to capture changes. Triggers automatically execute specified actions when events like inserts, updates, or deletes occur. This method is straightforward to implement and compatible with many databases.

### Challenges:

* It can introduce significant overhead on the database.  
* Complex to manage and debug, especially in high-transaction environments.  
* Potential performance degradation if not carefully optimized.

## Log-based CDC

Log-based CDC reads the database transaction log to capture changes. It is highly efficient with minimal impact on the source database, and can handle high volumes of changes with low latency. This technique focuses on most real-time use cases and the evaluation document. However, access to the transaction log is required, which may not always be feasible depending on the database system.

### Challenges:

* Requires deep integration with the database system.  
* May face issues with proprietary log formats.  
* Log retention policies need careful handling to avoid data loss.
